        <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
        <p>
          Hey! Iâ€˜m a full stack developer with a deep passion in
          designing delightful user experiences that people can connect with. I specialise in front-end web development with knowledge in infrastructure and back-end.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm comfortable working on all aspects of design team management and
          the product cycle: from roadmapping and budgets, to research,
          prototyping journeys and crafting beautiful UIs, all the way through
          to working with development teams to ensure a seamless journey to
          production.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the past, I studied Digital Design at Curtin University, WA and
          dabbled in business and photography.
        </p>
        <p>When i'm not at my computer, I like to spend my time watching movies, reading and staying active.</p>
